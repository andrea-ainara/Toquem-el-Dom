Tools Used for the Escuela de Rock

To bring the Escuela de Rock to life, we utilized a combination of powerful web development tools:
- HTML: The backbone of the website’s structure, HTML provides the layout and organization of each page, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the various instruments and interact with the content.
- CSS: For styling, CSS was used to create an engaging and visually striking design. It enhances the user experience with vibrant colors, animations, and responsive layouts, making the site as exciting as the instruments it showcases.
- JavaScript: The magic behind the interactivity of the site. JavaScript powers the clickable note features for each instrument, allowing users to listen to each sound by simply interacting with the on-screen keys or pads. It also adds dynamic effects and smooth transitions for a seamless experience.
- Audio Libraries: Custom audio libraries or sound files are integrated to accurately replicate the sounds of each instrument, providing users with high-quality, interactive audio feedback as they explore.
