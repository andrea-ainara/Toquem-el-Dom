            <h2>Did you damn know?</h2>
            <p>The pan flute, one of the oldest musical instruments, has a history deeply rooted in ancient
                civilizations across the globe. It's believed to have originated in ancient Mesopotamia and is also
                closely associated with Greek mythology, where it's linked to the god Pan. The instrument, characterized
                by its multiple pipes of varying lengths, has been found in archaeological sites dating back thousands
                of years and has played a significant role in cultural ceremonies and traditional music across various
                cultures.
