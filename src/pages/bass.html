    <p class="paragraph">The HEAVIEST electric bass guitar, as we know it, emerged in the 1930s with designs like Paul Tutmarc's Model 736 Bass Fiddle, though it wasn't until the 1950s that Leo Fender's Precision Bass achieved commercial success and widespread adoption. Prior to this, the double bass was the primary instrument for low-frequency bass lines in various musical genres. </p>
